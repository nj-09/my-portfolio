# My-Portfolio/Challenge-2

In this first challenge, I have attempted to make a portfolio to contain my projects and developments as a front-end web developer.

## Installation
I used an existing starter code provided to me by my bootcamp. I first created a new repository on GitHub, cloned the repository to my local machine and used the git add . command to verify if the files have been connected.

An example of the challenge where it has a comment workflow to organise changes.
