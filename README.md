# My-Portfolio with HTML and CSS

In this first challenge, I have attempted to make a portfolio to contain my projects and developments as a front-end web developer.
The URL of the deployed application: https://nj-09.github.io/my-portfolio/

## Installation
I used an existing starter code provided to me by my bootcamp. I first created a new repository on GitHub, cloned the repository to my local machine and used the git add . command to verify if the files have been connected.

An example of the challenge where it has a comment workflow to organise changes.
